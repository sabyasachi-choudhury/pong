Repo 6 of a collection of repos, containing the random python and pygame projects I've worked on

The classic game of pong - the original video game. The 'AI' is pretty garbage, but could be made much better and even allow for difficulty levels by programming it
to go the wrong direction once every N seconds, where N varies with difficulty. Or better yet, generate a random number from 0 to N at every iteration, and if it equals 0, 
make the AI go the wrong direction for some number of game loops. Larger N means more difficulty.
